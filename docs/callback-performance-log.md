# Daisy callback performance log

This is the durable report for the recurring callback-headroom gate defined in
[`performance_monitoring.md`](performance_monitoring.md#callback-headroom-gate).
One row represents one scenario, captured in its own serial log, on the
persistent QSPI `-O2` image with DWT profiling enabled. Host timings and the
`-O0` SRAM debug image do not belong here, and the helper refuses them.

Record a run with `make perf-record`. The helper reads the firmware's
`profile_config:` line (core clock, sample rate, block size, storage layout,
optimization level) and every `audio_callback` profiling window in the
capture, computes utilization from the raw `DWT->CYCCNT` counts against the
budget `core_hz * block_size / sample_rate`, and classifies the worst observed
callback. **Hz/block**, **Core**, **Image**, **Budget cycles** and
**Stream underruns** are read from the capture, not typed in. A trailing `+`
in **Commit** means the measurement came from a dirty tree.

**Stream underruns** counts the SD-stream ring running dry
(`AudioEngine::CheckAndLogUnderruns()` episodes), which is a refill problem and
can happen under a comfortable callback. It is not a callback overrun. Zero is
required for the gate to pass, but the cycle columns are what the **Decision**
band is made from.

The log deliberately records whether callback-resident features remain. At
80% or above that answer changes the architectural decision: remaining work
activates the backend chip-upgrade path; a feature-complete build is still
blocked from release or further callback scope until its margin is resolved.

## Workload and evidence notes — 2026-09-07

Both captures used firmware commit 176ce1f, persistent QSPI -O2, 480 MHz,
48 kHz, and 48-sample blocks. Capture metadata and image SHA256 values are in
perf-wavex-20260907-212459.json and perf-daisysp-20260907-222524.json. The
WaveX run covered Track 0 pitches 60–67 at velocity 100,
/Drums/Kicks/bassdr01.wav (44.1 kHz mono, full-file loop), the singleton SD
stream, 120 BPM / 16 steps / 60% swing, eight simultaneous preview rows every
four steps, eight instrument modulation slots (LFO1, LFO2, and voiceLFO to
cutoff, gain, pitch, and pan; depth 8000; exponential and S curves), cutoff
alternating between 32768 and 60000 about once per second, resonance 45000,
and sustain 65535.

Parameter locks were programmed, but the current callback does not apply them;
they add no measured DSP workload and remain roadmap Phase 2 item 5. Both
captures recorded zero measured boot/runtime underruns. The measurements cover
the whole callback only; they do not separately time Render(), placement A/B,
physical DIN/USB latency, listening or loop-seam quality, hot-unmount recovery,
or the four-track sequencer gate. The TSAN runtime was unavailable because its
mapped runtime library could not be loaded. Normal persistent firmware was
restored after profiling, and the final two-board console smoke run passed 7/7
selected tests (39 deselected).
