# Daisy callback performance log

This is the durable report for the recurring callback-headroom gate defined in
[`performance_monitoring.md`](performance_monitoring.md#callback-headroom-gate).
One row represents one scenario, captured in its own serial log, on the
persistent QSPI `-O2` image with DWT profiling enabled. Host timings and the
`-O0` SRAM debug image do not belong here, and the helper refuses them.

Record a run with `make perf-record`. The helper reads the firmware's
`profile_config:` line (core clock, sample rate, block size, storage layout,
optimization level) and every `audio_callback` profiling window in the
capture, computes utilization from the raw `DWT->CYCCNT` counts against the
budget `core_hz * block_size / sample_rate`, and classifies the worst observed
callback. **Hz/block**, **Core**, **Image**, **Budget cycles** and
**Stream underruns** are read from the capture, not typed in. A trailing `+`
in **Commit** means the measurement came from a dirty tree.

**Stream underruns** counts the SD-stream ring running dry
(`AudioEngine::CheckAndLogUnderruns()` episodes), which is a refill problem and
can happen under a comfortable callback. It is not a callback overrun. Zero is
required for the gate to pass, but the cycle columns are what the **Decision**
band is made from.

The log deliberately records whether callback-resident features remain. At
80% or above that answer changes the architectural decision: remaining work
activates the backend chip-upgrade path; a feature-complete build is still
blocked from release or further callback scope until its margin is resolved.

## Workload and evidence notes — 2026-09-07

Both captures used firmware commit 176ce1f, persistent QSPI -O2, 480 MHz,
48 kHz, and 48-sample blocks; only the filter topology/slope differed. Capture
metadata and image SHA256 values are in the local, gitignored logs/
perf-wavex-20260907-212459.json and logs/perf-daisysp-20260907-222524.json. The
WaveX run covered Track 0 pitches 60–67 at velocity 100,
/Drums/Kicks/bassdr01.wav (44.1 kHz mono, full-file loop), the singleton SD
stream, 120 BPM / 16 steps / 60% swing, eight simultaneous preview rows every
four steps, eight instrument modulation slots (LFO1, LFO2, and voiceLFO to
cutoff, gain, pitch, and pan; depth 8000; exponential and S curves), cutoff
alternating between 32768 and 60000 about once per second, resonance 45000,
and sustain 65535.

Parameter locks were programmed, but the current callback does not apply them;
they add no measured DSP workload and remain roadmap Phase 2 item 5. Both
captures recorded zero measured boot/runtime underruns. The measurements cover
the whole callback only; they do not separately time Render(), placement A/B,
physical DIN/USB latency, listening or loop-seam quality, hot-unmount recovery,
or the four-track sequencer gate. TSAN discovery was unavailable with
FATAL: ThreadSanitizer: unexpected memory mapping. Normal persistent firmware was
restored after profiling, and the final two-board console smoke run passed 7/7
selected tests (39 deselected).


## Track-addressed follow-up — 2026-09-07

Commit 66d0330 used the same persistent QSPI -O2, 480 MHz, 48 kHz and
48-sample-block configuration. The local capture is
logs/perf-wavex-20260908-003427.log (UTC filename); its companion JSON records
the clean commit, image SHA256, baseline and periodic device state.

This workload bound Tracks 0–7 to the same full-file-looped
/Drums/Kicks/bassdr01.wav and triggered MIDI note 60 on each. All eight
Instruments had eight modulation slots with the source, destination, depth
and curve settings described above. Each Track used resonance 45000 and
sustain 65535; cutoff alternated between 32768 and 60000 on all eight Tracks
roughly every 1.2 seconds. The WaveX 24 dB filter ran at 100% drive.
Sequencing used 120 BPM, 16 steps, 60% swing and simultaneous hits every
four steps. The other eight rows were muted, and the singleton SD stream
ran concurrently.

All sampled states retained eight voices and an active stream with zero
underruns or dropped commands. The DWT run remains in STAY. This is a
different workload from the earlier fixed-Track chromatic preview, so the
rows are capacity evidence rather than a direct performance comparison.
Parameter locks are still stored but not applied. Physical panel timing,
DIN/USB clock sync, audible loop quality and the full Phase 2 gate remain
unverified.

Normal persistent firmware was restored after capture. The final console and
Track-routing HIL selection passed 12/12 tests (39 deselected), including
scoped releases on four Tracks, rebinding, asynchronous SFZ replacement and
sample edits reaching future sequenced hits. Five new host voice-map tests
also passed, along with the required commit hooks.
